# DocuMark
Client-side watermarking with a topographical overlay. Vanilla JS + HTML5. Test out the [demo](https://iflp.github.io/documark/)!
## How?
Using the HTML 5 canvas to overlay an SVG over the source image, with the output as a .png.
## Why?
Sometimes I want to watermark sensitive documents and I don't trust the internet.
